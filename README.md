Dog Recognizer App
===========================

In this project, I will build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models for classification, I will explore important design options about the user experience for the app.
